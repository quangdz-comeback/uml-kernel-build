# vdeplug-go — gVisor netstack rewrite of vde_plug

A drop-in replacement for the C `vde_plug` SLIRP helper that UML's VDE
VECTOR transport execs, written in Go on top of gVisor's netstack.
The C helpers (`legacy/`, `vde_plug/`) remain standalone builds; this
rewrite exists to fix their structural problems: CPU burn in the frame
pump, no failover, and no isolation between guests.

## Layout

    main.go               fleet state machine + runInstance (all uplinks)
    internal/link         seqpacket fd <-> gVisor channel.Endpoint bridge
    internal/vswitch      L2 switch: MAC learning, flood, inline fast path
    internal/nat          netstack NAT (NAT44, NAPT66, ICMP, DNS)
    internal/dhcp         frame-layer DHCP server + lease pool w/ restore
    internal/portfwd      hostport -> guest port forwarding
    internal/tap          host tap uplink (TUNSETIFF)
    internal/unixseq      SOCK_SEQPACKET bind/connect/accept helpers
    internal/elect        flock seat + heartbeat/lease-gossip beacons
    e2e_test.go           full fleet failover test, no UML kernel needed

## Roles and failover

Every instance runs the same binary. On startup it either

- joins an existing hub (`TryConnect`) and becomes a **peer**, or
- takes the **hub seat** — an exclusive `flock` on `<socket>.lock` —
  and binds the switch socket.

Peers watch hub **heartbeats** (L2 ethertype 0x88B5, magic `VDHB`):
three missed 1-second beats mean the hub is wedged, and the peer
re-enters discovery. Because the seat is a kernel flock, a dead hub
releases it even on SIGKILL; the first peer to win the lock rebinds the
socket and promotes. Promotion is crash-stop safe and split-brain
impossible: only the seat holder ever binds the socket.

Failback is **sticky**: a returning old hub finds the seat taken and
joins as a plain peer. Hub heartbeats also carry the DHCP lease table
(≤32 leases per frame), so a promoted hub keeps issuing the addresses
the old hub had handed out.

Guests DHCP by default (NoCloud seed: `dhcp4: true` on vec0) and get
one lease per MAC — nested LXC/Docker containers bridged onto the
guest's NIC each get their own address from the same pool
(`dhcp_start` + 256). Verified end-to-end: six live leases on one
helper (guest + bridge + two veth CTs + a second guest), hub killed,
the promoted hub inherited the exact table and the CTs reclaimed their
old addresses through it.

## Uplinks (`uplink:` in config.yaml)

- `slirp` — netstack NAT44 + DHCP + portfwd (default, C-binary parity)
- `tap:NAME` — raw host tap device (needs cap_net_admin; see below)
- `none` — isolated guest LAN

The uplink is per-instance; guests on the same switch see each other
east-west regardless of their hubs' uplinks.

## Guest MAC persistence

UML derives the vec0 MAC from the kernel cmdline, so the launcher
generates a random local MAC once per rootfs image (sidecar
`<image>.mac`, mode 0600) and injects `mac=` on every boot. DHCP leases
and switch learning stay stable across reboots.

## Switch sockets (`socket_file_location:` in config.yaml)

The switch socket defaults to `/tmp/vde.socket` (the C binary's
cascade). `socket_file_location:` names it explicitly:

- a **file path** — a unix SOCK_SEQPACKET socket, as always;
- **host:port** — a remote raw socket: the helper dials a TCP hub (or
  binds the port itself when nobody answers), with a 2-byte
  length-prefixed frame per message. Peers may live on other machines;
  the hub seat's flock applies per machine, the TCP bind is the real
  seat across them.

### Bridging over WebSocket (`helpers/vdews`)

When the hub has no routable address, `vdews` carries the switch over
WebSocket (TLS handled by the reverse proxy in front):

    vdews -mode serve -listen :5001 -upstream /tmp/vde.socket -token S   # hub side
    vdews -mode connect -downstream /tmp/vde-remote.sock \
          -url wss://hub.example/vde -token S                            # peer side

Each peer wire = one WebSocket connection; frames ride as binary
messages so packet boundaries survive end-to-end, and the peer's own
retry loop drives reconnects. `socket_file_location:
/tmp/vde-remote.sock` points the helper at the local end.

Verified over the real internet (hub behind a reverse proxy at
wss://quangdz.exe.xyz, a peer on a VPS across the world): ICMP both
directions between a real UML guest and a `fakeguest` peer, 0% loss at
one internet RTT (~225ms). Note the topology: the seat (flock + socket
file) lives on the hub's machine, so distributed failover promotes
within that machine only — remote peers keep retrying while the hub's
machine is down, by design.

## Testing

    go vet ./... && go test ./...

The e2e test builds the binary and drives three fake guests over
socketpairs (fd 3): first node takes the seat, ARP flows, the hub is
killed, a survivor promotes, the old hub returns as a peer. CI runs it
plus a static build matrix (`.github/workflows/vdeplug_go.yml`).

## Deploy note

The tap uplink needs `cap_net_admin` on the helper binary; re-apply
after every install (`sudo setcap cap_net_admin+ep vdeplug-netstack`).
